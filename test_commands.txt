A. Direct commands (no AI call)

Handled by handleDirectCommand(input):

File & folder management
	•	create file filename.txt → creates a new file.
	•	delete file filename.txt → deletes that file.
	•	create folder myFolder → creates folder (uses mkdirs()).
	•	mkdir myFolder → same as above.
	•	delete folder myFolder → deletes folder recursively.
	•	rmdir myFolder → same as above.

System information
	•	show cpu usage / cpu usage → runs
top -l 1 | grep 'CPU usage'
	•	show ram usage / ram usage → runs
vm_stat | head -5
	•	show disk usage / disk usage → runs
df -h / | tail -1
	•	list processes → runs
ps aux | head -20
	•	kill process 1234 → runs kill 1234

File compression
	•	compress file somefile.txt
→ runs zip somefile.txt._compressed.zip somefile.txt
	•	compress somefile.txt
→ same internally.

AI-like local suggestions (no API)
	•	“suggest rare files in /path”
	•	suggest rare files /Users/... → scans last access time, prints rarely accessed files.
	•	“suggest large files in /path”
	•	suggest large files . → finds files > 10MB.
	•	“suggest duplicate files in /path`
	•	“suggest cleanup in /path”
	•	“suggest archive in /path”
	•	“suggest backup in /path`

Scheduling (demo)
	•	schedule backup my folder → prints
⏲️ Task scheduled to run in 10 sec(s).
After 10 sec:
⏲️ Scheduled task executed: schedule backup my folder

B. AI-generated shell commands (using Gemini)

If handleDirectCommand returns false, then:
	1.	It builds a prompt: buildPrompt(input)
→ “You are a macOS terminal assistant… Convert user instruction into SAFE shell command…”
	2.	Calls getCommand(input):
	•	Tries multiple model names with Gemini HTTP API.
	•	If successful, gets a shell command as text.
	3.	Shows:
    🔧 Suggested Command:
            <command-here>
            Run this command? (yes/no):
C. Help & exit
	•	help → prints full list of 40 commands (for the user UI).
	•	exit → shuts down scheduler and exits with “👋 Bye my friend!”.
